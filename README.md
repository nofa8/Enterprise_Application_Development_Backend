Overview
Enterprise Application Development is a robust, scalable Java application designed to demonstrate best practices in building enterprise-level applications. Leveraging Jakarta EE and Hibernate ORM, this project provides a solid foundation for developing, deploying, and managing large-scale applications with complex business logic and data handling needs.

Features
Jakarta EE: Utilizes Jakarta EE's extensive enterprise capabilities to handle web services, transaction management, security, and dependency injection for streamlined application development.
Hibernate ORM: Ensures efficient data persistence and management through an object-relational mapping framework, simplifying database interactions with Java objects.
MVC Architecture: Implements a modular, Model-View-Controller architecture for better separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
RESTful APIs: Supports RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with front-end applications and other services.
Transaction Management: Provides robust transaction handling and error management for secure, reliable data processing.
Role-Based Access Control: Ensures security with customizable access levels based on user roles.
Scalability and Performance: Built with a focus on high-performance and scalability to meet the demands of enterprise applications.
